      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a 
      document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS enhances the visual appeal and layout of 
      web pages by defining how elements should be displayed on screen, in print, or other media types. 
      It facilitates the separation of content from presentation, allowing developers to maintain 
      consistency and easily update the design across multiple pages.
    </p>
    <p class="text different">
      CSS operates on a cascade principle, meaning that multiple style sheets can influence the 
      presentation of a document. Styles can be applied directly to HTML elements or grouped into classes 
      and IDs for more targeted styling. This modularity and cascading nature enable developers to 
      efficiently manage the appearance of complex websites while promoting reusability and 
      maintainability of code.
    </p>  
    <p class="different">
      Key features of CSS include its extensive set of properties and values, which control aspects such 
      as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. Selectors determine which elements the styles apply to, 
      offering flexibility and precision in styling.
      CSS is a rule-based language â€” you define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be 
      applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page.
      CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. 
      In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values. We also have the 
      font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value.
